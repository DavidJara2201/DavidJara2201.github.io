# David Jaramillo Calle

Welcome to my gitHub page, here I will be posting different projects and sharing my knowledge.

## Profile: 

Undergraduate student of the statistics major in the "Universidad Nacional de Colombia" in Medellin. With emphasis in statistical and machine learning methodologies for data analysis, data science, data manipulation, etc.

Solid background using R, Python and Excel for statistical analysis including statistical inference, supervised and unsupervised learning, data visualization, anomaly detection, natural language processing, etc. power BI for business intelligence, as well as, SQL for relational databases.

## Projects in English:

### R:

#### Classification of the satisfaction level in customers.
This project focuses on the understanding of the satisfaction of customers with a specific airline's service. To do this, exploratory analysis is initially performed. Afterwards, a variety of classification models are constructed, tuned and finally compared to select the one that best classifies dissatisfied customers.

#### Linear models to explain the effect of term limits in the percentage of female participation in politics.
Implementation of linear models in order to explain and predict the percentage of women participating in a political environment depending on the use or not of term limits.

This project includes assumption testing for the OLS model as well as the utilization of generalized models and the respective comparison between all the built models to finally select the most accurate and correct one of the options for its purpose.

It was completed as part of a freelance deal with a client.

#### Shiny app for breast mass analysis and prediction.
Utilization of a shiny app that includes data visualizations, summaries and prediction of the type of a mass in a breast using variables measured from its cells nuclei.

#### Classification of the sentiment of COVID-related tweets using NLP.
Brief analysis of text and usage of NLP techniques in order to create a model able to classify covid-related tweets according to the sentiment they express, whether it is positive, negative or neutral.

#### Unsupervised learning for customer segmentation (data pulled from SQL server)

Implementation of k-means algorithm to segment customers that have purchased products in a certain business in the United States. As well as exploratory analysis on the generated clusters in order to better understand how these are formed and how the people in them behave.

#### Linear mixed models to describe and predict a newborn's weight
This project goes over the implementation and comparison of a number of differente linear mixed models in an attempt to properly describe, explain and predict the weight of a newborn in the city of Medellin, Colombia.

#### Examples for sampling methods for distributions.
This project was completed as part of a freelance deal with a client. Regarding, sampling a number of different distributions using the inverse tranform method or the rejection method.

### Python: 

#### Face mask recognition model using tensorflow
Construction of deep neural network that can accurately predict the way a person is wearing a face mask (correctly, incorrectly or not wearing one).

#### Classification of rainy days using supervised learning.
This project goes over a number of different variables that may or may not influence the chances of rain in Australia, in order to finally create a model that can, as accurate as possible, classify whether the next day will be rainy or not.

#### Prediction for the amount of money spent after one year as a client.
In this project, several machine learning models, including regression and classification ones, were built in order to give a reasonable predcition for how much money a new customer will spend in their first year (for the regression models) and whether said customer will be a "big buyer" or not (for the classification models) based on customer data pulled from SQLServer from a certain company.

### SQL 

#### Exploratory analysis on Covid-19 in Colombia and the world.

In this project, a very brief yet valuable exploratory analysis is performed over some data regarding number of cases and deaths due to covid-19, as well as the number of vaccinations in the vast majority of countries around the world.

## Projects in Spanish:

### R:

#### Predicción del precio de un Renault Logan con regresión bayesiana. 
Proyecto realizado para predecir el valor de venta de un renault logan a partir de una muestra de sus respectivos años y utilizando información apriori obtenida al entrevistar expertos en la materia para construir una regresión lineal con MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) y que nos lleva a construir su respectiva dsitribución posterior.

#### Predicción de la precipitación en Ethiopia.
Proyecto geoestadístico donde se estudia la distribución de la precipitación de Ethiopia y los diferentes supuestos necesarios para posteriormente generar un modelo a través de "Kriging" capaz de predecir la precipitación en cada punto del país.
